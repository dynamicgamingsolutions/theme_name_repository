**Instructions and Information on the Theme view from Google AppSheet**

The "Theme" view in the Asset Locator Map allows users to search all listed themes in the Dynamic Gaming Solutions catalogue. Themes are grouped by Vendor, Cabinet, & Theme. The themes that are listed are cabinet specific. This means if one theme can go on multiple cabinets, they will be listed under each individual cabinet.
